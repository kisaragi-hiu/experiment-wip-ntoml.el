Goal: TOML 1.0 decoder / encoder

I'm probably sticking with this name.

** TODO pass 1.0 decoder tests
** TODO implement array tables

#+begin_quote
The last syntax that has not yet been described allows writing arrays of tables. These can be expressed by using a header with a name in double brackets. The first instance of that header defines the array and its first table element, and each subsequent instance creates and defines a new table element in that array. The tables are inserted into the array in the order encountered.
#+end_quote

** TODO encoder
